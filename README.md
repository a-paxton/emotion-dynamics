# Emotion dynamics during conflict discussions

This repo contains the code for the analyses presented in our journal article, "An exploratory analysis of emotion dynamics between mothers and adolescents during conflict discussions" (Main, Paxton, &amp; Dale, accepted, *Emotion*).

To accompany the code, we also provide de-identified data for two dyads (contained in the `data` folder). We include the emotion time series for one low-satisfaction dyad and for one high-satisfaction dyad.

**Note**: For best viewing in a *browser*, we recommend selecting the `Main_Paxton_Dale-all_analyses.md`, rather than the similarly named `.Rmd` file.
