# Emotion dynamics during conflict discussions

This repo contains the code for the analyses presented in our journal article, "An exploratory analysis of emotion dynamics between mothers and adolescents during conflict discussions" (Main, Paxton, &amp; Dale, accepted, *Emotion*). To accompany the code, we also provide de-identified data for two dyads.

Note: For best viewing in a browser, we recommend selecting the `Main_Paxton_Dale-all_analyses.md`, rather than the `.Rmd` file.
